### Purpose of Repository
The repository will hold copies of the slides and notes from the seminars I have led through Purdue's Machine Learning Reading Group from Fall 2023 to the present. 


### Disclaimer
Most notes.md files were copied from local notes taken through Obisidian. Therefore, some formatting issues are probably in the .md file. These should be resolved when looking at the rendered data instead of the raw text file.
Additionally, not all seminars and/or notes were able to be uploaded.
